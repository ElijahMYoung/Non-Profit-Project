          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            A group of ordinary but passionate people that believes every pet has a story, each one worth saving, each life individual and important. We are recognized as leaders in all aspects of animal care and rescue, with practices and innovations that are leading the way in animal care nationwide. For us rescuing animals is always the number one priority, and everything else was subordinate to that.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              We’re making sure that every adoptable pet has access to the comfort of a foster home instead of a kennel in a shelter. We’re committed to creating communities, including our own workplace, in which everyone is valued and respected. Individually, we can save a few. But working together with you, and our foundation, corporate and network partners, we can save them all.
